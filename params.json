Here's the recommended computer specs for GMod:\r\n\r\nOS:  WindowsÂ® 7/8/8.1/10  (You can use Debian for the server.) \r\nProcessor: 2.5 GHz Processor or better \r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 1GB dedicated VRAM or better \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection \r\nStorage: 10 GB available space\r\n\r\nNote, It is NOT recommended to play on the server and host the server on the same PC.\r\n#Network\r\nThis is the part for the NETWORKING.\r\nYou're going to need to forward the port 27015 through 27005, both TCP and UDP.\r\nThis is pretty much it for networking. You might want to turn off your firewall, too.\r\n\r\n#Getting the script\r\nYou will have to install Virtualbox with Debian Jessie for this to work if you are not a debian user.\r\nSet it to 4880 MB, and set the amount of cores. \r\n\r\nDownload the script, and extract the .ZIP, then open the folder.\r\nLaunch the SetupGarrysModServer.sh script.\r\nIt's very self-explanatory, so I'm going to skip the part. \r\n\r\n#After...\r\nSo, there should be a GMOD_ReadMe.txt. Read it, and it should tell you how to turn it on.\r\nLets say you turn on GMod, and go look for your server, you join, but it's laggy. I had this issue, but I put in something to make it work. Go to /home/gm/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysModDS/garrysmod/cfg/server.cfg (Directory may vary) and put in (anywhere) the following:\r\n\r\nsv_minrate 0\r\nsv_maxrate 0\r\nsv_minupdaterate 10\r\nsv_maxupdaterate 66\r\n\r\nIt might not work for everyone, but it worked for me. \r\n\r\n#More Server.cfg\r\nYou can customize your server with the server.cfg. Here's a good website to help! http://robinschoors.com/?p=244\r\nCopy the text into your server.cfg. \r\n\r\n#Mounting CSS\r\nIt will install CSS:Dedicated server for you. But, to mount it, follow these steps. \r\nGo to /home/gm/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysModDS/garrysmod/cfg/mount.cfg\r\nOpen it, and you will see something like this:\r\n\r\n \"mountcfg\"\r\n {\r\n \t//\"cstrike\"\t\"C:\\steamcmd\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source Dedicated Server\\cstrike\"\r\n \t//\"tf\"\t\t\"C:\\mytf2server\\tf\"\r\n }\r\n\r\nFirst, find the //\"cstrike\", and remove the 2 //'s. then, replace the directory (The C:\\steamcmd\\blahblah in the quotes)  with \"/home/gm/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Source Dedicated Server/cstrike/\" (Directory may vary), save, and restart server.\r\n\r\nThat would be about everything, you can contact me on steam or something if you have issues.\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Senvr11/\r\n",
