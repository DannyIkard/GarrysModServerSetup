Here's the recommended computer specs for GMod:\r\n\r\nOS:  WindowsÂ® 7/8/8.1/10  (You can use Debian for the server.) \r\nProcessor: 2.5 GHz Processor or better \r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 1GB dedicated VRAM or better \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection \r\nStorage: 10 GB available space\r\n\r\nNote, It is NOT recommended to play on the server and host the server on the same PC.\r\n#Network\r\nThis is the part for the NETWORKING.\r\nYou're going to need to forward the port 27015 through 27005, both TCP and UDP.\r\nThis is pretty much it for networking. You might want to turn off your firewall, too.\r\n\r\n#Getting the script\r\nYou will have to install Virtualbox with Debian Jessie for this to work if you are not a debian user.\r\nSet it to 4880 MB, and set the amount of cores. \r\n\r\nDownload the script, and extract the .ZIP ",
